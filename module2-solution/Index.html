<h1>Visual Elements In Content Marketing</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-11"><p class="box1">Calls To Action</p>
  <p id="p1">Graphics are a great way to connect more emotionally with your audience. When a prospect is interacting with your webpage or blog articles, it’s essential to have a CTA (Call To Action). The purpose of a CTA is to have users perform an action, such as clicking a link, leaving a comment, or subscribing, before you lose their attention. This allows for further interaction with the prospect.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-11"><p class="box2">Infographic</p>
  <p id="p1">Infographics stand out among other visual formats. They allow brands to repurpose their content in a more visually pleasing way. You’re able to present information and knowledge more clearly. When content is presented in a unique format the more influential and convincing it seems. Infographics are a creative way to draw attention to your content, and drive traffic back to your website.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-11 col-sm-11"><p class="box3">Blog Post Graphics</p>
  <p id="p1">Visual content is processed faster than text. Before your audience begins to read your content, their opinion is shaped by the design. This is the first opinion your audience will form without even reading the content.</p></div>
